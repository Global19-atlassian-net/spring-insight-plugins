h1. MongoDB plugin for Spring Insight

Spring Insight runs in the SpringSource tc Server. See http://www.springsource.org/insight for details. This plugin adds instrumentation to for web applications that use MongoDB (http://www.mongodb.org) through the MongoDB Java driver, which typically works outside the normal ORM flow. 

h2. Compatibility

This plugin is compatible with the 1.8+ versions of insight. It may
be compatible with 1.5+ (not tested).

h2. Installation

You may install this plugin by copying the plugin jar to
<code>
  insight/collection-plugins
</code>

For both the Dashboard and Insight Agent. You should see the
plugin listed under the administration panel.

h2. What does it do?

It instruments calls to MongoDB from the Java driver. Typical calls on the DBCollection class are traced, as are the DB.command() calls that are not covered by these. 

The DBCursor.next() call is traced but the information for each call is limited. For example, it does not provide the corresponding DBCollection (yet).

Some attempt is made to decode parameters and return values for common and MongoDB types we know about.

h2. Known issues

# The collection name is not available from DBCursor, so we can't see which collection we're calling next() on. This is going to be simply a matter of coercing DBCursor to give up a private instance field for which there is not accessor. (I'm sure I read somewhere how to do that.)

h2. Rejected enhancements

# I thought that Morpia support belonged here at some point. But that's less interesting now that GORM support for MongoDB is provided by a Grails Datastore and not by a contributed plugin (gorm-mongodb) that uses Morphia. YMMV, in which case feel free to add it.
